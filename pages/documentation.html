        <h2>What was the process like?</h2>
        <p>
            I started off just by changing the images on all of the cards and then the different backgrounds. I went through a few different iterations of the background, but ended up with some stone and paper ones to fit the fantasy theme. Then, I added in a timer bar to limit how long players have to match the cards. I had a lot of trouble with this at first, but then managed to get it to work after a few hours. Next, I worked on getting end game states; that also took a long time. I couldn't get the game to actually clear the board when you lose at first, so I worked on that more for a few hours. It finally worked, and that's when everything came together. The win condition was simple after that, as was adding in and changing the character portrait/text. Finally, I created an array of the given card image locations in the CSS and made the deck a random assortment of that for just a little more variety. Honestly, this is probably my favorite project we've worked on in this class yet. I surprisingly had a really fun time, even if my game still has a few quirks and doesn't look gorgeous.

        <h2>Anything special to see?</h2>
        <p>
            There are only some small things. I mostly like how the character on the side of the screen changes her facial expression based on what happens. There's a different face for getting a match, not getting a match, the start of the game, losing the game and winning the game.

        <h2>How were project requirements met?</h2>
        <p>
            I feel like my game is simple but fairly fun! It's cute and I think I did some original stuff with the character speaking to you on the sidelines. There aren't any game breaking errors, but there are just a few small things that are kind of weird that I didn't know how to fix(the character's text isn't always aligned perfectly, the progress bar moves higher onto the page when the game ends). I commented more than I usually do and I spent a lot of time on this assignment and ended up having a great time. I initially wanted to just stop after the timer was added because I thought I didn't have the skills to add in the changing character art, but then I got that working. Once again, I was then going to leave it at that...but I decided to have changing cards every time the game loads for more replayability. I worked on this project alone, so I think I did a decent amount of work.

            If I were to give myself a grade, I'd maybe give myself an A-. I know it's not an especially beautiful game, but I think it looks ok for someone who isn't really a web specialist. It's more of an A- for the amount of time and effort I put into it. Programming and understanding the logistics of it take a very long time and are difficult for me, so I'm pretty pleased with it.
